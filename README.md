# Automatic-Light-Control
•	Developed an energy-efficient Automatic light control system using an ATMega164A Chip. 
•	The system used a Photoresistor to detect light levels, a Potentiometer as a manual threshold and a LCD with I2C connection to display messages.
•	When the light was too strong, the LED would turn off, and the message “Too much light, ECO mode ON” appeared. When light levels were low, the LED would turn on, showing “Not enough light, ECO mode OFF” on the display, optimizing energy consumption
